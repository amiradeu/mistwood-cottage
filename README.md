# Mistwood Cottage : A Story in the Hills

> _Fog drapes over the hillside like a memory ‚Äî soft, shifting, never fully still. In the heart of it all stands a solitary cottage, hiding a simple life of comfort._

Mistwood Cottage is a cozy, interactive 3D experience built with WebGL and Three.js, where players can wander through a hand-crafted stylized world of hills, fog, and simple pleasures. With dynamic day-night cycles, atmospheric shaders, peaceful interiors, and playful exploration mechanics, it‚Äôs a space designed for calm immersion and quiet storytelling.

## üöß Roadmap / Todo

-   [ ] Fix physics inconsistency causing uneven player movement and jump behavior across browsers and devices.
-   [ ] Introduce subtle story moments and narrative touchpoints across the terrain.
-   [ ] Add more interactive elements and relaxing mini games to encourage deeper exploration.
-   [ ] In-game photo mode to capture scenic views.
-   [ ] Redesign the water shader from a realistic to a stylized look that better complements the world.
-   [ ] Improve visual cues to indicate that the cottage walls can be toggled.
